This project is intended to help with the issue of physical VR Locomotion in games. Many game levels are seriously limited by
a userâ€™s game space. Our goal was to create a system that using the sensors of the HTC Vive dynamically scale procedurally generated
game levels to match the size of a players room. By developing our own constraint based system, we are working towards creating 
game levels that flow seamlessly and allow the player to exploit as much of their floor space as possible. 

This is a work in progress and updates will be made regularly.
